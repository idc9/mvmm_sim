# Simulations for multi-view mixture modeling paper


The code in this repository reproduces the results of [(Carmichael, 2020)](TODO: LINK TO PAPER)



To run all the simulations do the following (note you have to write in a couple hard coded paths for where simulation output data should be saved!)

```
git clone https://github.com/idc9/mvmm_sim@SOMETAG

# change paths in mvmm_sim/simulation/Paths.py

pip install .

sh run_all_simulations.sh
```
